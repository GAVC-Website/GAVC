Hello! 

  All of the newest updates in both the INDEX page and the DRONES page is inside of the GAVC Website folder. 
  I'd highly recommend using the code from there.  
  Additionally, if your website isn't looking anything like how it should, refer to the DRONES page, or copy the basic layout from BASIC.
  
Thanks!
